# GIS-Web-App
A complex web-based Geographic Information System (Web GIS) interface is displayed in the HTML document, which combines OpenLayers for mapping and Bootstrap for styling. With features like base maps, overlays, zoom sliders, scale lines, and a layer switcher for improved user interaction, it provides a powerful tool for exploring spatial data. Location searches are made easier with the help of geocoding features, and the map's scale is dynamically indicated by a custom scale bar. With its integration of modal windows for a thorough exploration of geographic data, layer management, popups to display information about specific map features, and geospatial querying, the interface excels in user experience.
